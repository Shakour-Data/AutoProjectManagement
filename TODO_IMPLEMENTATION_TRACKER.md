## Daily Progress Log

### Day 1: Initial Setup
- ✅ Analyzed current scope_management.py implementation
- ✅ Analyzed current quality_management.py implementation
- ✅ Created missing quality_standards.json file
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan
- ✅ Created detailed implementation tracker

### Day 2: Notification Service Implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive notification service with multiple channels
- ✅ Implemented email, Slack, Teams, and console notification support
- ✅ Created notification templates for scope changes, quality alerts, and approvals
- ✅ Added retry mechanisms and delivery tracking
- ✅ Created standardized notification templates JSON file

### Next Actions:
1. Integrate notification service with scope_management.py
2. Set up email/Slack integration infrastructure
3. Begin implementation of validation service
