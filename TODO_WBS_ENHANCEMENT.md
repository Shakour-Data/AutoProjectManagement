# WBS Aggregator Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: Hierarchical Numbering Implementation
- [x] Analyze current WBS aggregator structure
- [x] Understand existing WBS data format and hierarchy levels
- [x] Enhance WBS aggregator to generate hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)
- [x] Add hierarchical numbering to task objects during aggregation
- [x] Ensure proper hierarchical structure processing
- [x] Test with sample WBS data

## Phase 2: Integration and Testing
- [x] Verify hierarchical numbering in aggregated output
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with Gantt chart data generator
- [ ] Test with existing WBS parts

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Next Steps)
- [ ] Implement task dependency management
- [ ] Integrate with scheduler for project start date
- [ ] Enhance resource leveling with resource definitions
- [ ] Add Microsoft Project-like features (Gantt chart with dependencies)

## Current Status: Phase 1 Completed
- Hierarchical numbering successfully implemented and tested
- Output shows proper hierarchical structure with WBS numbers: 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
- Ready for integration with Gantt chart data generator
