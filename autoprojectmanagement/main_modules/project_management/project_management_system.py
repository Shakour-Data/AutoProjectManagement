    ================================================================================
    Project Management System - Core Orchestrator for AutoProjectManagement
    ================================================================================
    
    The ProjectManagementSystem class serves as the central orchestrator for all
    project management operations within the AutoProjectManagement ecosystem. It
    provides a comprehensive, production-ready system for managing projects, tasks,
    and maintaining data integrity across all operations with robust error handling,
    validation, and persistence capabilities.
    
    Key Features:
        - Complete CRUD operations for projects and tasks
        - JSON-based data persistence with automatic file management
        - Comprehensive input validation and error handling
        - Thread-safe operations with proper state management
        - Integration with the broader AutoProjectManagement API ecosystem
        - Support for complex project-task relationships
    
    Architecture:
        This class follows a modular architecture where:
        - Projects are stored as dictionaries with unique integer IDs
        - Tasks are organized hierarchically under their parent projects
        - Data is persisted to JSON files for reliability and portability
        - All operations maintain referential integrity
    
    Attributes:
        projects (Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]): Dictionary mapping project IDs to project data
        tasks (Dict[int, Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]): Nested dictionary structure where:
            - First key: Project ID
            - Second key: Task ID  
            - Value: Task data dictionary
        is_initialized (bool): Flag indicating whether the system has been initialized
    
    Data Persistence:
        - Projects are stored in: .auto_project_data/projects.json
        - Tasks are stored in: .auto_project_data/tasks.json
        - Automatic directory creation and file management
        - UTF-8 encoding with proper JSON serialization
    
    Error Handling:
        - Comprehensive type checking for all inputs
        - Proper exception handling with descriptive error messages
        - Graceful degradation for file operations
        - Validation of required fields and data integrity
    
    Example Usage:
        >>> from autoprojectmanagement.main_modules.project_management.project_management_system import ProjectManagementSystem
        >>> pms = ProjectManagementSystem()
        >>> pms.initialize_system()
        True
        >>> project_data = {"id": 1, "name": "Test Project", "description": "A test project"}
        >>> pms.add_project(project_data)
        True
        >>> task_data = {"id": 101, "title": "Implement feature", "status": "pending"}
        >>> pms.add_task_to_project(1, task_data)
        True
        >>> pms.list_projects()
        [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Test Project', 'description': 'A test project'}]
    
    Integration:
        This class integrates with:
        - API endpoints for RESTful operations
        - Real-time monitoring services
        - Dashboard and reporting modules
        - Task execution and workflow systems
    
    Security Considerations:
        - Input validation prevents injection attacks
        - File operations use secure paths and permissions
        - No external dependencies on untrusted data sources
    
    Performance:
        - O(1) average time complexity for most operations
        - Memory-efficient data structures
        - Lazy loading of data from persistence layer
    
    Thread Safety:
        - Not inherently thread-safe (external synchronization required)
        - File operations include proper locking mechanisms
        - State changes should be synchronized in multi-threaded environments
    
    Extensibility:
        - Designed for easy extension with new project/task attributes
        - Modular architecture allows for custom persistence layers
        - Well-defined interfaces for integration with other systems
