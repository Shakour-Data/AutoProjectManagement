# Task Dependency Management Implementation Plan

## Phase 2: Task Dependency Management

### 1. Analyze Current Structure
- [ ] Examine existing task data format for dependency support
- [ ] Review Gantt chart data generator for dependency integration
- [ ] Study resource leveling implementation for dependency awareness

### 2. Dependency Data Model
- [ ] Define predecessor/successor relationship structure
- [ ] Implement dependency types (FS, SS, FF, SF)
- [ ] Add lag time support for dependencies

### 3. Dependency Validation
- [ ] Implement circular dependency detection
- [ ] Validate dependency relationships
- [ ] Ensure dependency consistency across WBS levels

### 4. Integration with WBS Aggregator
- [ ] Enhance WBS aggregator to handle dependencies
- [ ] Propagate dependencies through hierarchical structure
- [ ] Validate dependencies during WBS aggregation

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test basic dependency relationships
- [ ] Test complex dependency scenarios
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid dependencies

## Phase 3: Microsoft Project-like Features

### 1. Enhanced Gantt Chart Generation
- [ ] Integrate dependencies into Gantt chart data
- [ ] Add project start date calculation
- [ ] Implement critical path analysis

### 2. Resource Management
- [ ] Enhance resource leveling with dependency constraints
- [ ] Add resource allocation validation
- [ ] Implement resource conflict resolution

### 3. Scheduling Features
- [ ] Add task duration estimation
- [ ] Implement milestone tracking
- [ ] Add baseline comparison

## Current Focus: Starting Phase 2
- Begin with analyzing current task structure for dependency support
- Implement basic predecessor/successor relationship management
