## 1. Strategic Acceptance Testing Framework

### 1.1 Business Value Alignment

Our acceptance testing strategy is directly aligned with business objectives through:

1. **Value-Driven Testing**: Each test case maps to specific business value
2. **User-Centric Design**: Tests designed from actual user workflows
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Critical business functions receive highest priority
4. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing validation throughout development lifecycle

### 2.2 Comprehensive UAT Test Scenarios

#### 2.2.1 Project Lifecycle Testing

**Scenario 1: End-to-End Project Management**
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Project Management Lifecycle
  As a Project Manager
  I want to manage a project from initiation to closure
  So that I can deliver successful projects

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a Project Manager
    And I have access to the project management dashboard

  Scenario: Create and manage a software development project
    When I create a new project "Website Redesign"
    And I set the project timeline from "2025-08-01" to "2025-10-31"
    And I assign team members to the project
    And I create project tasks and milestones
    And I track progress daily
    And I generate weekly reports
    And I manage risks and issues
    Then the project should be completed successfully
    And all stakeholders should be satisfied with the outcome
    And the project should be within budget and timeline
```
