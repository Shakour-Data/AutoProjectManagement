# Plan for Continuing Scope Control and Quality Management Automation

## Current State Analysis

### Scope Management (scope_management.py)
**âœ… Strong Foundation:**
- Comprehensive scope change processing with impact analysis
- Approval workflow automation (automatic for low-risk, requires approval for medium/high)
- GitHub issue integration for scope change tracking
- Baseline management with versioning and comparison
- Audit trails and comprehensive reporting
- Dependency analysis and impact calculation

**ðŸ”§ Areas for Enhancement:**
- Add automated scope change notifications and alerts
- Implement scope change validation against project constraints
- Create automated scope change reporting templates
- Enhance scope change rollback capabilities
- Improve integration with GitHub issues for change requests

### Quality Management (quality_management.py)
**âœ… Basic Implementation:**
- Quality score calculation based on standards
- Basic quality level classification (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, POOR)
- Simple recommendation generation
- Project-level quality summary

**ðŸ”§ Major Enhancements Needed:**
- Implement automated quality metric selection and weighting
- Add quality planning based on project type and complexity
- Create quality planning templates for different project types
- Implement automated quality standard generation
- Add quality planning integration with risk assessment
- Create quality planning validation against industry standards
- Implement quality planning optimization algorithms
- Add automated quality planning documentation generation
- Integrate quality planning with project scheduling
- Implement quality planning feedback loop for continuous improvement
