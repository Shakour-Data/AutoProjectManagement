# Test Coverage and Quality Metrics

## Overview
This document defines the comprehensive test coverage requirements and quality metrics for the AutoProjectManagement system. It ensures that all modules meet the minimum 20-test requirement and maintain high quality standards.

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Standards

| Module Type | Minimum Tests | Coverage Requirement | Criticality |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Core API Modules | 20+ | 90%+ | High |
| Service Modules | 20+ | 85%+ | High |
| Main Modules | 20+ | 80%+ | Medium |
| Utility Modules | 20+ | 75%+ | Medium |
| Model Modules | 20+ | 95%+ | High |
| Storage Modules | 20+ | 90%+ | High |

### Test Category Distribution

Each module must have tests distributed across these categories:

```yaml
test_distribution:
  functionality: 5 tests    # 25%
  edge_cases: 5 tests       # 25%  
  error_handling: 5 tests   # 25%
  integration: 5 tests      # 25%
  total: 20 tests           # 100%
```

## Quality Metrics

### Test Quality Scorecard

| Metric | Weight | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | 30% | 80%+ | Code coverage percentage |
| Test Count | 20% | 20+ | Number of tests per module |
| Test Distribution | 15% | Balanced | Even distribution across categories |
