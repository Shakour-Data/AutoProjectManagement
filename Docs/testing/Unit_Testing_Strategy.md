# Unit Testing Strategy for AutoProjectManagement

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive unit testing strategy for the AutoProjectManagement system. The strategy ensures that all modules have at least 20 unit tests covering functionality, edge cases, error handling, and integration scenarios.

## Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation when possible
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each module must have 20+ unit tests
- **Automation**: All tests should be automated and runnable via CI/CD
- **Quality Gates**: Tests must pass before code can be merged

## Test Categories

### 1. Functionality Tests (5 tests per module)
- Test core functionality and business logic
- Verify expected behavior under normal conditions
- Cover all public methods and interfaces

### 2. Edge Case Tests (5 tests per module)
- Test boundary conditions and extreme values
