## Core Use Cases

### UC-001: Initialize New Project

**Primary Actor**: Project Manager  
**Goal**: Set up a new project with proper structure and configuration  
**Preconditions**: Git repository exists, user has appropriate permissions  

**Main Flow**:
1. User runs initialization command
2. System validates project structure
3. JSON configuration files are created
4. GitHub repository is configured
5. Initial backup is created
6. Project dashboard is initialized

**Alternative Flows**:
- **AF-1**: Repository doesn't exist → System creates new repository
- **AF-2**: Configuration exists → System offers to update or reset

**Postconditions**: Project is ready for team collaboration

    participant PM as Project Manager
    participant CLI as CLI Interface
    participant Engine as Core Engine
    participant GitHub as GitHub API
    participant JSON as JSON Store
    
    PM->>CLI: init-project "NewProject"
    CLI->>Engine: validate structure
    Engine->>JSON: create configs
    Engine->>GitHub: setup repository
    GitHub-->>Engine: repository ready
    Engine->>JSON: save project metadata
    Engine-->>CLI: initialization complete
    CLI-->>PM: project ready
```

### UC-002: Automated Task Creation

**Primary Actor**: Senior Developer  
**Goal**: Create tasks from requirements or code changes  
**Preconditions**: Project is initialized, requirements are defined  

**Main Flow**:
1. Developer commits code changes
2. System analyzes commit content
3. Tasks are automatically created/updated
4. Task priorities are calculated
5. Resources are allocated
6. Progress is tracked

**Task Creation Process**:
