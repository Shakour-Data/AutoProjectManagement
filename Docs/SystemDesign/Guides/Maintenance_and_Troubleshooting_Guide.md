## Common Issues

### API Connection Issues
- **Symptoms**: Unable to connect to API endpoints, timeout errors.
- **Possible Causes**: Server not running, network issues, firewall restrictions.
- **Solutions**: 
  - Verify the server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
  - Check network connectivity and firewall settings.
  - Review server logs for errors.

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- **Symptoms**: WebSocket connections failing, connection timeouts.
- **Possible Causes**: Incorrect WebSocket URL, server configuration issues.
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/ws`
  - Check server configuration for WebSocket support.
  - Review browser console for WebSocket errors.

### Data Loading Issues
- **Symptoms**: Data not loading, empty responses from API.
- **Possible Causes**: Database connection issues, file permission problems.
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify database connection settings.
  - Check file permissions for data files.
  - Review application logs for database errors.

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Database Backup**: Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss.
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes.
- **Security Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor system performance metrics such as response times and error rates.
- Set up alerts for performance degradation or system failures.
- Regularly review and optimize database queries.

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Server Status
```bash
# Check if the server is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Check server logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/autoprojectmanagement/server.log
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $API_KEY
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Verify configuration file
cat config.json
```

### Step 3: Review Logs
```bash
# View application logs
tail -f /var/log/autoprojectmanagement/application.log

# View error logs
tail -f /var/log/autoprojectmanagement/error.log
```

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

# Test project listing
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects

# Test dashboard endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/overview?project_id=project-001
```

## Best Practices

### Security Best Practices
- Use HTTPS for all production deployments.
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks.

### Performance Best Practices
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize database queries for better performance.
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures.

### Monitoring Best Practices
- Set up monitoring for system health and performance metrics.
- Implement alerting for critical failures or performance issues.
- Regularly review logs for errors and anomalies.
