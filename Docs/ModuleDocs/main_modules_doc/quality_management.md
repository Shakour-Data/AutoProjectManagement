    """
    Quality management system for evaluating and maintaining code quality standards.
    
    This class implements comprehensive quality evaluation based on detailed WBS
    and quality standards, providing metrics and recommendations for improvement.
    """
    
    def __init__(self,
                 detailed_wbs_path: str = 'JSonDataBase/Inputs/UserInputs/detailed_wbs.json',
                 quality_standards_path: str = 'JSonDataBase/Inputs/UserInputs/quality_standards.json',
                 output_path: str = 'JSonDataBase/OutPuts/quality_management.json') -> None:
        """
        Initialize the quality management system.
        
        Args:
            detailed_wbs_path: Path to detailed WBS JSON file
            quality_standards_path: Path to quality standards JSON file
            output_path: Path where quality results will be saved
        """
```

### Quality Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_quality_score(self, task: Dict[str, Any], 
                              standards: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Calculate quality score for a specific task based on standards.
    
    Args:
        task: Task dictionary containing task details
        standards: Quality standards dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing quality metrics and score
    """
```

```python
def _generate_recommendations(self, metrics: Dict[str, Any], 
                                quality_level: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate quality improvement recommendations based on metrics.

## Usage Examples

### Enterprise Deployment Pattern
```python
from autoprojectmanagement.main_modules.quality_commit_management.quality_management import QualityManagement

# Initialize quality management system
quality_mgr = QualityManagement()

# Run quality analysis
quality_mgr.run()

# Access quality report
quality_report = quality_mgr.output
print(f"Overall Quality Score: {quality_report['summary']['overall_quality_score']}")
```

### Development Environment Setup
```python
# Development configuration with testing focus
dev_quality_mgr = QualityManagement(
    detailed_wbs_path='./detailed_wbs.json',
    quality_standards_path='./quality_standards.json',
    output_path='./quality_management_report.json'
)

# Run quality analysis
dev_quality_mgr.run()
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
```python
try:
    quality_mgr = QualityManagement()
    quality_mgr.run()
    
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
    # Handle configuration issues
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    # Generic error handling
```
