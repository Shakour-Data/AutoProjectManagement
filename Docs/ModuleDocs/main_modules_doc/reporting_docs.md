# Reporting Module Documentation

## Level 1: Overview and Purpose

### Module Overview
The `reporting.py` module is the comprehensive reporting framework within the AutoProjectManagement system. It provides a unified interface for generating integrated project management reports by combining data from multiple sources including WBS, resource allocation, time management, risk management, and quality management systems.

### Primary Purpose
This module serves as the central reporting hub that integrates disparate project data sources into cohesive, actionable reports. It enables stakeholders to gain holistic insights into project health, resource utilization, timeline adherence, risk exposure, and quality compliance through standardized reporting formats.

### Key Responsibilities
- Load and integrate data from multiple project management domains
- Generate comprehensive project summaries and analysis reports
- Perform cross-domain consistency checks and validations
- Provide actionable recommendations based on integrated analysis
- Handle data validation and error conditions across multiple sources
- Save unified reports in standardized JSON format
