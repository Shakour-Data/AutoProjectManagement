## Level 3: Detailed Implementation

### Core Class: FeatureWeights
The `FeatureWeights` class serves as the central coordinator for feature weight management, providing comprehensive functionality for calculating weights and supporting decision-making.

### Weight Calculation Algorithm
The weight calculation process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Feature Evaluation**: Assess features based on predefined criteria
2. **Weight Application**: Apply appropriate weights to each feature
3. **Priority Calculation**: Determine overall priority based on weighted features

### Weight Calculation Formula
The weight calculation follows this formula:
```
Combined Weight = (Urgency Weight + Importance Weight) Ã— Feature Value
```

Where:
- **Urgency Weight**: Predefined weight for urgency features
- **Importance Weight**: Predefined weight for importance features
- **Feature Value**: Specific value assigned to the feature
