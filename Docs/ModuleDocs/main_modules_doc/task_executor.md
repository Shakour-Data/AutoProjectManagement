## Level 3: Detailed Implementation

### Core Class: TaskExecutor
The `TaskExecutor` class serves as the central coordinator for task execution, providing comprehensive functionality for executing tasks, tracking progress, and monitoring performance.

### Execution Algorithm
The execution process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Task Validation**: Verify task parameters and constraints
2. **Execution Planning**: Plan execution sequence and resource allocation
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and update task progress
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track execution performance and metrics

### Data Structures and Schemas

#### Task Schema
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "title": "Task Title",
      "description": "Task Description",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "progress": 50.0
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Execution Report Schema
```json
{
  "execution_summary": {
    "total_tasks": 10,
    "completed_tasks": 5,
    "in_progress_tasks": 3,
    "pending_tasks": 2,
    "average_progress": 60.0
  }
}
```
