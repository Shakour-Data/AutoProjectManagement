## Level 3: Detailed Implementation

### Core Class: ImportanceUrgencyCalculator
The `ImportanceUrgencyCalculator` class serves as the central coordinator for task evaluation, providing comprehensive functionality for calculating task priorities based on importance and urgency.

### Priority Calculation Algorithm
The priority calculation follows a weighted scoring system that considers both importance and urgency:

**Priority Score Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Importance × Weight₁) + (Urgency × Weight₂)
```

Where:
- **Importance**: Task's importance score (0-100 scale)
- **Urgency**: Task's urgency score (0-100 scale)

### Data Structures and Schemas

#### Task Schema
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "title": "Task Title",
      "description": "Task Description",
      "importance": 90.0,
      "urgency": 80.0
    }
  ]
}
```
