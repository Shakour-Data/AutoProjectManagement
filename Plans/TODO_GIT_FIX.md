# Git Push Issue Resolution Plan

## Issues Identified:
1. âœ… Credentials exposed in Git remote URL
2. âœ… Large PDF files causing memory allocation issues
3. âœ… Overly aggressive Git memory configuration

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Security: Remove credentials from remote URL
- [x] Remove current remote with exposed credentials
- [x] Add secure remote using SSH or proper authentication

### 2. Configuration: Optimize Git memory settings
- [x] Reduce http.postbuffer to reasonable size (100MB)
- [x] Memory settings already optimized (pack.*, core.*, transfer.*)

### 3. File Management: Handle large files
- [x] Add PDF patterns to .gitignore
- [x] Git LFS already configured and tracking large binary files

### 4. Testing: Verify fixes work
- [x] Test Git push with new configuration âœ…
- [x] Verify authentication works properly âœ…

## Current Status: Git push successful! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of Fixes Applied:
1. âœ… Removed credentials from remote URL (security)
2. âœ… Reduced http.postbuffer from 500MB to 100MB (performance)
3. âœ… Added large file patterns to .gitignore (memory optimization)
4. âœ… Used clean HTTPS URL without embedded credentials
5. âœ… Successfully pushed changes to GitHub

The memory allocation error has been resolved and Git operations should now work reliably.
