# Authentication Tests Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for the authentication system in the AutoProjectManagement application. It includes details on unit tests, API endpoint tests, and security tests.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests are designed to verify the functionality of individual components within the authentication system. The following areas will be covered:

- **User Registration**: Test the registration logic, including validation and error handling.
- **User Login**: Test the login process, including successful and failed login attempts.
- **Password Management**: Test password reset and recovery functionalities.
- **Token Management**: Test JWT token generation, validation, and expiration handling.

### 2. API Endpoint Tests
API endpoint tests will ensure that all authentication endpoints behave as expected. The following endpoints will be tested:

- **User Registration** (`POST /auth/register`):
    - Test valid registration requests.
    - Test registration with existing email.
    - Test registration with invalid data.

- **User Login** (`POST /auth/login`):
    - Test valid login requests.
    - Test login with incorrect credentials.
    - Test login for unverified accounts.

- **Password Reset Request** (`POST /auth/request-password-reset`):
    - Test valid password reset requests.
    - Test password reset for non-existent users.

- **Password Reset Confirmation** (`POST /auth/reset-password`):
    - Test valid password reset confirmation.
    - Test invalid token handling.

- **User Profile Retrieval** (`GET /auth/profile`):
    - Test retrieval of user profile with valid token.
    - Test retrieval with expired or invalid token.

- **User Logout** (`POST /auth/logout`):
    - Test logout functionality.

### 3. Security Tests
Security tests will verify that the authentication system is robust against common vulnerabilities:

- **JWT Token Security**: Ensure that tokens are securely generated and validated.
- **Password Hashing**: Verify that passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text.
- **Rate Limiting**: Test that the system correctly limits login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that all inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.

## Testing Tools
- **pytest**: For running unit tests.
- **httpx**: For making HTTP requests to test API endpoints.
- **Postman**: For manual testing of API endpoints.
- **Burp Suite**: For security testing and vulnerability scanning.

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pytest test_auth.py
```

To test API endpoints, use Postman or curl to send requests to the running server.

## Conclusion
This document serves as a guide for testing the authentication system. It outlines the areas to be tested, the tools to be used, and the procedures for running tests. Ensuring thorough testing will help maintain the integrity and security of the authentication system.
