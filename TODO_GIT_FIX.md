# Git Push Issue Resolution Plan

## Issues Identified:
1. ✅ Credentials exposed in Git remote URL
2. ✅ Large PDF files causing memory allocation issues
3. ✅ Overly aggressive Git memory configuration

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Security: Remove credentials from remote URL
- [x] Remove current remote with exposed credentials
- [x] Add secure remote using SSH or proper authentication

### 2. Configuration: Optimize Git memory settings
- [x] Reduce http.postbuffer to reasonable size (100MB)
- [ ] Adjust other memory-related settings if needed

### 3. File Management: Handle large files
- [x] Add PDF patterns to .gitignore
- [ ] Consider Git LFS for large binary files

### 4. Testing: Verify fixes work
- [ ] Test Git push with new configuration
- [ ] Verify authentication works properly

## Current Status: Ready to test Git push...
