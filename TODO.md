# Organization Plan for AutoProjectManagement

## Current Issues Identified:
1. **Duplicate files** - Many files exist both in main_modules root and subdirectories
2. **Inconsistent naming** - Some files have "_refactored" suffix while others don't
3. **Mixed organization** - Some modules are organized in subdirectories while others are in root
## Phase 2: Directory Structure Optimization
- [ ] Create `services/core/` directory.
- [ ] Move comprehensive implementations to the core directory.
- [ ] Update imports accordingly.

## Phase 3: Standardize Documentation
- [ ] Ensure consistent documentation format across all modules and functions.

## Phase 4: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionalities work.
- [ ] Fix any broken references.
- [ ] Verify no functionality loss.
