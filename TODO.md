### Integration Strategy (GitHub + VS Code Focus):

**Current Priority Integrations:**
- [ ] **GitHub Full Integration**: Complete API integration with all GitHub features
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Comprehensive VS Code extension development
- [ ] **GitHub + VS Code Synergy**: Seamless integration between GitHub and VS Code

**Future Integration Architecture:**
- [ ] **Modular Design**: Create plugin architecture for future integrations
- [ ] **API Abstraction Layer**: Design extensible API layer for third-party tools
- [ ] **Configuration System**: Build config system for future integration enablement
- [ ] **Documentation Framework**: Prepare documentation structure for future plugins

**No Current Integration Needed:**
- ❌ Trello integration (future possibility)
- ❌ Jira integration (future possibility) 
- ❌ Other project management tools (deferred for future development)

**GitHub-Centric Development:**
- [ ] Maximize GitHub Free Tier features utilization
- [ ] Leverage GitHub Actions, Pages, Packages, and Discussions
- [ ] Build around GitHub's ecosystem and APIs
- [ ] Use GitHub as the primary data storage and collaboration platform

**VS Code Extension Focus:**
- [ ] Native VS Code extension with full IDE integration
- [ ] Command palette integration for all GitHub operations
- [ ] Status bar indicators for GitHub project status
- [ ] Webview panels for project management within VS Code

**Extensibility Design:**
- [ ] **Plugin System Architecture**: Design for future third-party integrations
- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Prepare for future external service webhooks
- [ ] **API Gateway**: Create API structure for future tool integrations
- [ ] **Authentication Framework**: Design for multiple auth providers in future

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build solid GitHub + VS Code foundation first
- Design with extensibility in mind from the beginning
- Document extension points clearly for future developers
- Keep architecture modular and plugin-ready
- Avoid tight coupling with specific external services

**Future Integration Preparation:**
- [ ] Create integration interface specifications
- [ ] Document extension API for future developers
- [ ] Build sample plugin template
- [ ] Establish integration testing framework
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines for plugin development
