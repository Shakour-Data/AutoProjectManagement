### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Assessment:

**Current TODO.md Completeness for Version 1.0:**

**✅ Core MVP Features Present:**
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Basic API integration and repository management
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Functional extension with basic commands
- [ ] **Project Management**: Basic CRUD operations for projects
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and developer guides
- [ ] **Testing**: Basic test coverage for critical functionality

**⚠️ Missing Core MVP Features:**
- [ ] **User Authentication**: No user management system (critical for multi-user)
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: No database integration (users need to provide their own)
- [ ] **Basic UI/UX**: Minimal user interface for non-technical users
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step production deployment instructions

**MVP Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Basic project management operations work
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Can connect to and interact with GitHub
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Basic extension functionality in VS Code
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions
- [ ] **Testing**: Critical path testing completed

**Version 1.0 Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] No critical bugs blocking basic usage
- [ ] Documentation covers all basic use cases
- [ ] Setup process is clear and works reliably
- [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback implemented

**Recommendation:**
- [ ] **API Gateway**: Create API structure for future tool integrations
- [ ] **Authentication Framework**: Design for multiple auth providers in future

**Development Philosophy:**
- Build solid GitHub + VS Code foundation first
- Design with extensibility in mind from the beginning
- Document extension points clearly for future developers
- Keep architecture modular and plugin-ready
- Avoid tight coupling with specific external services

**Future Integration Preparation:**
- [ ] Create integration interface specifications
- [ ] Document extension API for future developers
- [ ] Build sample plugin template
- [ ] Establish integration testing framework
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines for plugin development
