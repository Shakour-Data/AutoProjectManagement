### GitHub Actions Modernization:

**Deprecated Actions Migration:**
- [ ] **Update actions/upload-artifact**: Migrate from v3 to v4+ (current version)
- [ ] **Update actions/download-artifact**: Migrate from v3 to v4+ 
- [ ] **Update actions/cache**: Migrate from v2 to v3+
- [ ] **Update actions/checkout**: Migrate from v2 to v3+
- [ ] **Update actions/setup-python**: Migrate from v2 to v4+

**GitHub Actions Best Practices:**
- [ ] **Runner Version Management**: Ensure compatibility with latest GitHub runners
- [ ] **Workflow Optimization**: Optimize workflow execution time and resource usage
- [ ] **Artifact Management**: Proper artifact retention and cleanup policies
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Secure handling of GITHUB_TOKEN and other secrets
- [ ] **Dependency Caching**: Implement efficient dependency caching strategies

**Error Resolution Tasks:**
- [ ] **Fix Deprecated Actions**: Replace all deprecated GitHub Actions with current versions
- [ ] **Runner Compatibility**: Ensure workflows work with latest runner versions (2.328.0+)
- [ ] **Permission Management**: Properly configure GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
- [ ] **Workflow Validation**: Validate all GitHub Actions workflows for current syntax
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure workflows work across different runner versions

**Specific Fixes Needed:**
- [ ] Replace `actions/upload-artifact@v3` with `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- [ ] Update all other deprecated action references
- [ ] Test workflows with current runner version (2.328.0)
- [ ] Configure proper GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
- [ ] Implement artifact cleanup to avoid storage issues

**Prevention Measures:**
- [ ] **Automated Dependency Updates**: Set up Dependabot for GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Workflow Testing**: Regular testing of workflows with latest runners
- [ ] **Documentation**: Create guide for maintaining GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for deprecated actions usage
- [ ] **Backup Strategies**: Alternative deployment methods if Actions fail

**Migration Steps:**
1. Identify all deprecated actions in workflows
2. Replace with current versions
3. Test each workflow thoroughly
4. Update documentation
5. Set up monitoring for future deprecations

**Example Fix:**
```yaml
# Before (deprecated):
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# After (current):
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Test each workflow after migration
- [ ] Verify artifact upload/download functionality
- [ ] Check permission requirements
- [ ] Validate with different runner versions
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
