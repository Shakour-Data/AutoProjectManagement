### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Essential Features:

**Core MVP Features for Version 1.0:**

**User Authentication System:**
- [ ] **User Registration**: User signup with email verification
- [ ] **Login/Logout**: Secure login system with session management
- [ ] **Password Management**: Password reset and recovery functionality
- [ ] **Profile Management**: User profile creation and editing
- [ ] **Testing**: Basic test coverage for critical functionality

**⚠️ Missing Core MVP Features:**
- [ ] **User Authentication**: No user management system (critical for multi-user)
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: No database integration (users need to provide their own)
- [ ] **Basic UI/UX**: Minimal user interface for non-technical users
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [ ] **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step production deployment instructions

**MVP Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Basic project management operations work
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Can connect to and interact with GitHub
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Basic extension functionality in VS Code
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions
- [ ] **Testing**: Critical path testing completed

**Version 1.0 Readiness Checklist:**
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] No critical bugs blocking basic usage
- [ ] Documentation covers all basic use cases
- [ ] Setup process is clear and works reliably
- [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback implemented

**Recommendation:**
The current TODO.md tasks would create a **technical foundation** but not a fully polished Version 1.0. Additional MVP features needed:
1. User authentication system
2. Basic web interface or improved CLI UX
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Production deployment documentation
5. Basic user onboarding flow

**Next Steps for Version 1.0:**
- Prioritize MVP features over advanced integrations
- Focus on user experience and reliability
- Ensure smooth setup process for new users
- Implement basic authentication and data security
- Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide
