# GitHub Integration Audit Logging Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: GitHub Integration Audit Logging

### Tasks to Complete:
- [ ] Add audit service import and initialization to GitHub integration
- [ ] Add audit logging for issue operations (create, update, status changes)
- [ ] Add audit logging for comment operations (get, add)
- [ ] Add audit logging for webhook operations (create, get, update, delete)
- [ ] Add audit logging for webhook event processing
- [ ] Add audit logging for API request failures and successes
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for audit logging

### Implementation Details:

1. **Import Audit Service**: Add proper import and initialization of audit service
2. **Issue Operations**: Log all issue-related operations with appropriate metadata
3. **Comment Operations**: Track comment creation and retrieval
4. **Webhook Operations**: Monitor webhook lifecycle events
5. **Event Processing**: Log webhook event reception and processing
6. **Error Handling**: Ensure audit logging doesn't break GitHub operations

### Testing Requirements:
- [ ] Verify audit entries are created for all GitHub operations
- [ ] Test error scenarios to ensure graceful handling
- [ ] Validate audit data consistency and completeness
- [ ] Test with actual GitHub API interactions
